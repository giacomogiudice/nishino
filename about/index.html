        <p>
          Papers on tensor networks appear every day, but it is hard to keep track of them, since
          they span a vast number of <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> categories. For almost 30
          years, professor
          <a href="http://quattro.phys.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp/nishino_e.html">Tomotoshi Nishino</a> has
          been keeping track of papers related to tensor networks appearing on arXiv, and posting
          them on his <a href="http://quattro.phys.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp/dmrg/condmat.html">website</a>.

            Every morning (or evening), he accesses arXiv.org, and search key word such as DMRG,
            Renormalization, Entropy, Fidelity, Density, etc. from the abstract. After finding out
            preprints in this way, he reads tytle of most of the preprint listed in arXive again
            from the top to the bottom, or sometimes looks at authors. Articles detected in this
            primitive way is listed during the day.

          This is a simple reader for his website, which would include additional features like the
          abstract, a direct link to the PDF, and an arguably prettier formatting. All additional
          informations is obtained through the <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/api/">arXiv API</a>.
          If you are interested in the tech involved in building the website, or want to suggest
          improvements, head over to the project on
          <a href="http://github.com/giacomogiudice/nishino">GitHub</a>.
